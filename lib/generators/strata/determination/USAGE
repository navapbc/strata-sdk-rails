Description:
    Generates a Determination model, Determinable concern, migration, and spec for your host application.
    These files inherit from Strata::Determination and Strata::Determinable respectively, providing
    determination recording capabilities with extension points for your domain.

Usage:
    bin/rails generate strata:determination

This will create:
    - db/migrate/<timestamp>_create_strata_determinations.rb
    - app/models/determination.rb
    - app/models/concerns/determinable.rb
    - spec/models/determination_spec.rb
    - spec/models/concerns/determinable_spec.rb

Options:
    --skip-migration-check         Skip checking if strata_determinations table exists

About Determinations:
    Determinations record decisions or outcomes for aggregate roots (e.g., ApplicationForms).
    Include the Determinable concern in your models to enable determination recording:

        class MyApplicationForm < ApplicationRecord
          include Determinable
        end

    Then record determinations:

        form.record_determination!(
          decision_method: :automated,
          reason: "pregnant_member",
          outcome: :automated_exemption,
          determination_data: rules_engine_output,
          determined_at: Time.current,
          determined_by_id: user_id  # optional for automated
        )
