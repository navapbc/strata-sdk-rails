Description:
    Creates a standard set of files required for implementing a staff dashboard in applications using the `strata` gem.

Usage:
    bin/rails generate strata:staff

Examples:
    bin/rails generate strata:staff

This will create:
    Controllers:
        app/controllers/staff_controller.rb - Main staff dashboard controller inheriting from Strata::StaffController
        app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb - Tasks management controller inheriting from Strata::TasksController

    Views:
        app/views/staff/index.html.erb - Staff dashboard index page
        app/views/tasks/index.html.erb - Tasks listing page that renders strata/tasks/index template
        app/views/tasks/show.html.erb - Task detail page that renders strata/tasks/show template

    Tests:
        spec/requests/tasks_spec.rb - Request specs for tasks controller

    Routes:
        Adds staff dashboard routes including:
        - GET /staff (staff dashboard)
        - GET /staff/tasks (tasks index)
        - GET /staff/tasks/:id (task show)
        - PATCH /staff/tasks/:id (task update)
        - POST /staff/tasks/pick_up_next_task (assign next task)

Notes:
    - The generated staff controller includes TODO comments for implementing authentication and authorization
    - The tasks controller includes TODO comments for setting up case and application form relationships
    - The generated views render existing strata/tasks templates with appropriate locals
    - You'll need to customize the case_classes method in the staff controller to match your application's case models
    - The generated spec file includes TODO placeholders for implementing comprehensive tests
